before we get ahead of ourselves, let's get acquainted.

hi. 

i'm Caden. 

i'm a high school dropout and multiple-time business owner and business fail-er. 

i've done software support (mostly SaaS), remote monitoring and niche hardware support (digital billboards), corporate training and online education, and i'm a skilled arborist, with experience running, leading, and founding multiple tree care companies.

i've written over 50 songs and released two albums to Soundcloud (good luck finding them). i've been climbing rocks for 12 years and I never get tired of it. i write short stories and technical manuals for my own personal enjoyment. i've taught myself everything i know about programming and can read just about any language except Assembly. 

i code and write markdown in `vim` and my shell of choice is `zsh` with `oh-my-zsh` plugins. i use an ortholinear, mechanical keyboard because i spend a lot of time at the computer and i'm a freak for ergonomics. i climb on a stationary rope system, with 120' of canopy-tied xstatic paired with a rope runner pro. i the small stuff and i get into the weeds sometimes more than i spend time with the seeds. 

now you may not have understood half of that. and maybe you understood every word (congratulations), but the point is that you don't have to, in order to understand me.

because what i've been saying for quite some time now, is that we're all much more alike than we are different.

i'm a person with passions, insecurities, opinions, inside jokes, and contextual personalities.

just like you.

just like all of us.
