sometimes you've just gotta do it, okay?

you sit down (or stand up, for the sake of word count) and you just get to work. 

make it happen. 

fuck it we ball.

seriously.

and you're probably thinking to yourself, "Caden (because that's my name, for sake of word count), are you phoning this one in because you started drinking just a little bit too early 'cause your roommate came home early and it's his birthday tomorrow?"

to which i would reply, "you should *not* know that much about me, dude."

but i would also say, "no, dear creepy reader, i'm just going for the minimum that is viable given my current circumstances (for sake of word count)."

but also "yes."

> THE POINT IS "SHIP IT."

do the work. put in the effort. give yourself a chance.

but then use it as a learning opportunity that leverages more learning opportunities. don't pretend you can learn it all in the first attempt; expect, plan, and prepare to keep shipping something that is the minimum viable option given your current circumstances (for sake of word count). 

look, if you're like me (which you are, for the sake of word count) then you wanna perfect everything. if you think can't reach a certain standard for yourself, then you adjust the goal posts. but you don't widen them (which is making things easier), you narrow them (which is the opposite of that, for sake of word count). 

which is bullshit. and self-sabotage. and actually makes it harder to do anything ever again in the future.

look, i'm gonna say this as directly as i can:

> lower your standards.

but like... for your work. not your relationships.
